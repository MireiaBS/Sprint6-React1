# Getting Started with Create React App

First Project with React.

## What have I applied?

JavaScript
CSS

## About the App

In this small project I start the first concepts of React: props, components, styled components and hooks (UseState).

It is an application that tells the story of an astronaut, and through buttons we will go from sentence to know at what point in history we are and also change the background image.
